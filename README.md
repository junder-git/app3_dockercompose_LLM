Key Features:

No Shared Memory - Completely removed lua_shared_dict declarations
Redis-only Sessions - All session management handled in Redis
Complete Admin Routes - All admin API endpoints properly configured:

/api/admin/stats - System statistics
/api/admin/users/* - User management (list, pending, approve, reject)
/api/admin/session/* - Redis session management (status, force-logout, all, cleanup)
/api/admin/guests/* - Guest session management


Centralized Routing - Everything goes through aaa_is_who.lua for permission checking
Proper URL Patterns - Uses regex patterns to catch all variations:

^/api/admin/users(/|/(pending|approve|reject))?$ catches /api/admin/users, /api/admin/users/pending, etc.
^/api/admin/session/(status|force-logout|all|cleanup)$ for session management


Streamlined - Removed all the old shared memory session references and consolidates similar routes

The configuration now fully supports Redis-based session management with comprehensive admin controls while maintaining the clean routing architecture through aaa_is_who.lua!
